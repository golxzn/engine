Restricted Source-Available License (RSAL) — Version 1.2 Copyright (c) 2026
Ruslan Golovinskii (golxzn). All rights reserved.

Preamble This license makes the software and associated materials (“Library”)
publicly available under conditions that require visible attribution for
Commercial Use and strictly prohibit: (a) the use of the Library for training,
fine-tuning, evaluation, or dataset generation for artificial-intelligence or
machine-learning systems; and (b) the use of the Library within, by, or as part
of any Large Language Model, Neural Network, or other AI system, whether for
training or inference.

This is a source-available license and is NOT an Open Source Initiative (OSI)
approved open-source license.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definitions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. “Library” The original software, source code, binaries, assets, examples,
tests, and documentation distributed under this license.

2. “Commercial Use” Using, copying, modifying, incorporating, or distributing
the Library (or any derivative) in any product, service, or offering provided
for a fee, for commercial advantage, in connection with a for-profit entity, or
otherwise for monetary or strategic business benefit.

3. “Model” Any computational system that uses statistical, probabilistic,
neural, connectionist, or machine-learned techniques to produce outputs,
including but not limited to artificial intelligence systems, machine-learning
systems, neural networks, and large language models.

4. “Large Language Model” (LLM) Any Model designed to process, generate,
transform, or reason over natural language or code using neural-network-based
architectures, including but not limited to transformer-based or foundation
models.

5. “Neural Network” Any Model composed of interconnected nodes, layers, or
parameters whose behavior is determined by learned or adjusted weights,
regardless of size, architecture, or training method.

6. “Training” “Training” means any deliberate process that uses the Library (in
whole or in part) — or any material derived substantially from the Library — to
create, tune, fine-tune, validate, benchmark, or otherwise influence the
parameters, weights, architecture, or behavior of any Model.

   Training includes, without limitation: a) direct ingestion of Library files,
   text, content, or artifacts; b) inclusion in datasets used for Training; c)
   synthetic regeneration based on the Library for the purpose of Model
   development or evaluation; d) automated analysis that stores or transforms
   the Library for the purpose of producing training signals or
   training-related metadata.

   Explicit Exclusions (NOT Training): – transient runtime execution strictly
   for normal non-AI software operation; – compilation or static analysis that
   does not create AI training artifacts; – testing that does not influence or
   generate Model parameters or behavior.

7. “Model Usage” Any use of the Library by, within, or in conjunction with a
Model, including but not limited to: a) embedding the Library into a Model’s
runtime, inference pipeline, or execution environment; b) using the Library to
generate outputs consumed by a Model; c) invoking the Library as a tool,
plugin, function, or callable component of a Model-driven system; d) exposing
the Library’s functionality through an LLM-, NN-, or AI-controlled interface.

8. “Attribution Display” A clearly visible, human-legible notice containing the
Library name and rights holder, displayed in one or more of: product About
screen, main UI, splash screen, credit screen, documentation, printed
packaging, or the primary product website.

   Example: “Includes [LIBRARY NAME] — © Ruslan Golovinskii (golxzn). Used
   under license.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grant of Rights
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject to full compliance with this license, Licensor grants You a worldwide,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:

a) use, reproduce, and modify the Library for personal, academic, or internal
business use; b) distribute the Library or derivative works in source or binary
form, provided that all conditions in “Conditions” are fully satisfied.

No rights are granted for Training or Model Usage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conditions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Attribution for Commercial Use a) Any Commercial Use requires an Attribution
Display in a reasonably prominent location appropriate to the product form
factor. b) If the product lacks a user interface, attribution must appear in
documentation and the primary product website. c) Distributed binaries or
installers must include attribution in bundled materials or an About screen.

2. Prohibition on Training a) You shall not engage in Training using the
Library, directly or indirectly. b) You shall not permit or enable any third
party to use the Library for Training. c) Redistribution must preserve an
enforceable Training prohibition. d) Ambiguous use shall be presumed to be
Training unless explicitly licensed.

3. Prohibition on LLM and Neural Network Usage a) You shall not use the Library
for Model Usage. b) The Library shall not be embedded in, invoked by,
controlled by, or exposed through any LLM, Neural Network, or other Model. c)
You shall not provide the Library as a tool, extension, function, capability,
or callable interface to any Model. d) Redistribution must preserve an
enforceable prohibition on Model Usage identical in scope to this clause.

4. Redistribution and Derivatives Redistribution of the Library or derivatives
is permitted only if: a) all copyright notices, this license, and any NOTICE
file are preserved; b) each copy includes a clear statement that Training and
Model Usage are strictly prohibited; c) Commercial Use by downstream recipients
complies with Attribution rules.

5. No Conflicting Sublicenses You may not offer any sublicense or agreement
that modifies, weakens, or conflicts with this license.

6. Patent Rights No patent rights are granted unless explicitly stated in a
separate, signed agreement with the Licensor.

7. Trademark No trademark rights are granted except as required for Attribution
Display.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compliance & Verification
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Commercial Use, Licensor may request written certification of compliance
with Attribution, Training, and Model Usage prohibitions within 20 business
days. Reasonable evidence may be required under NDA.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Termination
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This license terminates automatically if You materially breach the Attribution,
Training, or Model Usage clauses and fail to cure within 30 days of written
notice. Immediate injunctive relief may be sought to prevent irreparable harm.

Upon termination, You must cease all use, distribution, and possession of the
Library and destroy all copies in Your control.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enforcement & Remedies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Licensor may seek injunctive relief, damages, statutory damages where
available, and recovery of reasonable legal fees.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disclaimer of Warranty

Limitation of Liability
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commercial Exceptions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Licensor may offer separate commercial licenses that permit Training or Model
Usage, modify Attribution, or grant additional rights. Contact: [CONTACT
