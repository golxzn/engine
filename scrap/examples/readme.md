# Examples

Each example is organized with number and level: `00-easy-what-the-f@#k`

There are 3 types of level:

- `easy` - Mostly a simple API usage;
- `hard` - More advanced Simple/Pro APIs mix;
- `dead` - I don't really understand those examples. I was drunk or something..

If you're here from the main readme, seeking for the advanced usage, just take
a look at any `dead` level.

## How to build & play?

If you're reading it from your code editor, you'd probably checked an
[options file][gzn-optinos.cmake]. So, enable `GZN_DEV_MODE` or explicitly
`GZN_BUILD_EXAMPLES`. All the examples will be built so you need to choose run
or debug target and go ahead.
